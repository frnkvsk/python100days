    ## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]

#2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price
day2 = round(float(last_2_days[1][1]))
#3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
dif = abs(day1 - day2)
#4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.
pct_dif = round(100 * ((day1 - day2) / day2), 0)
print('day1',day1,' day2',day2,' dif',dif,' pct_dif',pct_dif)

    articles = news_response.json()["articles"][:3]
    print(articles)
    ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/ 
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 

#6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

#7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation


    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.
news_list = [f"Headline: {article['title']}, \nBrief: {article['description']}" for article in articles]
print('news_list',news_list)
#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio. 



#Optional TODO: Format the message like this: 
"""
